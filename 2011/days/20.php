It's optimized for setting longer texts, but also works very well in headlines and leads. The font family has real italics and not just mathematically slanted Romans, and the dynamic cursive shapes root in handwriting. With 8 styles (4 weights + italics), the family is highly versatile and can be used for designs with a complex typographical hierarchy.";
